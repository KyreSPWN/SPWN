It is SPWN policy that screenshots of Z-node hits are REQUIRED before you hit the ship.

These screenshots shall be kept for at least 7 days after the hit, may be requested by SPWN officers, and must be given if proof of the Z-node is needed.

Communication will happen in Steve's discord server in the "stfc-roe-violations-only" room.
