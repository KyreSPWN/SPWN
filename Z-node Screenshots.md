### It is SPWN policy that screenshots of Z-node hits are REQUIRED *before* you hit a Z-node ship.

These screenshots shall be kept for at least 7 days after the hit, may be requested by SPWN officers, and must be given if proof of the Z-node is needed.

Communication will happen in Steve's discord server in the "stfc-roe-violations-only" room.

### How to take a Z-node screenshot:

STFC has differentiated what a node that has materials left looks like, from one that has been drained. Nodes that have materials left are brighter, while Z-nodes are duller.

The below image is an example of what the RoE Officer will expect as evidence if they request it. The information that needs to be shown in the screenshot is:
  - The node looking duller in color.
  - The name of the victim shown clearly.

Below is an example of a node that has vibrant color, showing that it still has material left in it.

You do not need to click on the node to bring up the node information. That obscures the name of the player sitting on the node.

If you have any questions about what is expected, please ask an Officer.
