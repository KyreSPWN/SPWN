## Welcome Spawners!

This repository is for information regarding the Spawn (SPWN) alliance in Star Trek Fleet Command Server 99.

Please familiarize yourself with [Server and SPWN Rules of Engagement (RoE) and Alliance Status Meanings](https://github.com/KyreSPWN/SPWN/blob/main/RoE.md), and what screenshots are required for [Z-node hits](https://github.com/KyreSPWN/SPWN/blob/main/Z-node%20Screenshots.md).

We have a discord server, and the link to that is available through the Announcements section of the alliance page in game. There are four rooms/collections that are specific to STFC:
- stfc-resources (a collection of handy information and links)
- star-trek-fleet-command (the main chat room)
- stfc-roe-violations-only (reports and discussion about RoE violations)
- stfc-absences (notifications for absences)

This is Steve's professional discord, so the other rooms in the server should remain free from discussions about the game.

If you have any questions about RoE, please contact KyreR in game or in the STFC rooms on discord.

You can get notifications when people post with an @stfc in the discord rooms! Here are the steps:
1. Go to the "star-trek-fleet-command" room on discord.
2. Open the magnifying glass search function.
3. Click on "Pins".
4. Find the following post and click it (it's near the top):
