## Welcome Spawners!

This repository is for information regarding the Spawn (SPWN) alliance in Star Trek Fleet Command Server 99.

Please familiarize yourself with [Server and SPWN Rules of Engagement (RoE)](https://github.com/KyreSPWN/SPWN/blob/main/RoE.md) and what screenshots are required for [Z-node hits](https://github.com/KyreSPWN/SPWN/blob/main/Z-node%20Screenshots.md).

If you have any questions about RoE, please contact KyreR in game.

We have a discord server, and the link to that is available through the Announcements section of the alliance page in game. There are four rooms/collections that are specific to STFC:
- stfc-resources (a collection of handy information and links)
- star-trek-fleet-command (the main chat room)
- stfc-roe-violations-only (reports and discussion about RoE violations)
- stfc-absences (notifications for absences)

This is Steve's professional discord, so the other rooms in the server should remain free from discussions about the game. 

You can get notifications when people post to the discord rooms!
