## Server 99 Rules of Engagement

Definitions can be found in PVP Target Guide https://www.pvptarget.com/guide 

Basic ROE as written in PVP Target Guide and summarized as below:
- All warships within the battle triangle are fair play
- OPC survey ships are fair play
- Including those sitting in space, returning home from mining, or returning home from a base raid
- UPC survey ships that are on z-nodes are fair play

Off-limit hits:
- Ships in token space
- Ships in active armadas or waiting for armadas
- Discovery only while mining mycelium and UPC

Not Protected by ROE:
- Base raids. Be aware that interfering with a base raid will likely cause hostilities. 
- Bases in general. Shield or Share.
- Survey ships acting as warships, including during base raids or hostile hunting for XP
- Territory, although almost every territory holding alliance will KOS you for hits there.

All alliances are welcome to add additional ROE for their alliance if that addition means fewer allowed hits.
- Example: An alliance can say that they will not hit z-nodes. If adding, the alliance should post and pin that in their embassy channel. 

The above rules promote fair and fun play. Regardless, any alliance at any time can declare war or KOS on another alliance based on its own reasoning, even if other alliances disagree. Should an alliance abuse war, other alliances may band together to put them in their place based on consensus.



## SPWN specific ROE:

- Our members are required to take screenshots of Z-node hits and keep for 1 week.

- UPC Miners:
    - UPC miners are protected by RoE and shall not be hit, including floating miners. The exception is a miner that is on a Z-node, in which case a screenshot is required, as previously described. Hitting a non-Z-node UPC miner will count as a strike.

- Territories are off limits for pvp with the following exceptions:
    - Time of war
    - Takeover events (We allow it but firmly believe the right thing to do is enter as intended, by submitting the RSS to enter the takeover. While this is our opinion, we respect that others may not view it the same way.)

- Q trial events in territory:
    - Please send a message in embassy that you will be entering territory for Q trial events & we will do our utmost to respond quickly and notify in AC that you are not to be harmed

- Infractions to these guidelines will be discussed with the offenders or applicable offender's alliance Admiral / ROE Officer to discuss the best next steps.

- SPWN has a 3 strike rule we are implementing beginning 10/8/23. We will hold our players accountable for items like no SS screenshots or ROE violations.



## SPWN Friendly Agreement with SPEC

In January, 2024, the alliances SPWN and SPEC entered into a Friendly agreement. 

These are the terms agreed upon by both alliances:

- Abide by RoE
- OPC hits are OK
- Z-node hits are only OK if you need the node (ie, there are no free nodes in the system).
     - Screenshots for Z-node hits are still required as per SPWN RoE

Off limits:
- Bases
- Auto Grinders
- Floaters
- Territory
- Token Space
