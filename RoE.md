## Server 99 Rules of Engagement

**Basic Server 99 Rules of Engagement (ROE)**

**Overarching Rules**
- Shield or share
- All alliances may apply more restrictive ROE for their alliance (i.e., rules resulting in fewer allowed hits)
- ROE is designed to promote fair and fun play, but does not restrict the ability of any alliance to declare war or KOS on another alliance based on its own reasoning, even if other alliances disagree. Should an alliance abuse war, other alliances may band together to put them in their place based on consensus. 
- See PVP Target Guide (https://www.pvptarget.com/guide) for Definitions/Additional Information. 
- If this channel and the PVP Target Guide conflict, this channel governs for Server 99

**Hits Allowed Under ROE**
- All ships acting as warships are fair play, including surveys engaging in base raids or hunting hostiles
- OPC survey ships are fair play, including those floating or traveling
- UPC survey ships that are on z-nodes are fair play
- Ships on specialty mining nodes for which they are not designed, except concentrated latinum when being mined with Arrock as captain.

**Off-limit Hits**
- Ships in token space, except in the Mirror Universe when acting as warships
- Ships within an active armada circle
- UPC survey ships that are floating or traveling are off limits
- Discovery only while mining mycelium and UPC

**Not Covered by ROE**
- Bases, including hives 
- Base raid interference (may cause hostilities between alliances) 

**Incursions**
- Begin boot and loot and strategic raiding territory bases no later than 24 hrs in advance of incursions
- Suspend ROE 4 hrs ahead of incursions

**Additional Definitions**
- Floating: sitting in space 
- Traveling: moving through space, including surveys returning to base from mining or raiding
- Specialty mining node: any node other than parsteel/tritanium/dilithium/crystal/ore/gas/isogen
- Token space: any system requiring an item be provided in exchange for entrance, irrespective of the name of the item
- Warship: any battleship, explorer, or interceptor; any ship engaged in PvP or hostile hunting; or any ship in another alliance's territory without invite, unless otherwise exempt under these rules.

## SPWN specific ROE:

Our RoE Officer is KyreR, Backup is FahQueue2
- Any RoE violations should be reported to them in the discord channel "stfc-roe-violations-only".
- If Kyre or FQ is unavailable for any reason, another officer will handle it.

- Our members are required to take screenshots of Z-node hits. **All screenshots must be posted in discord in the stfc-znode screenshot channel.** Failure to provide Z-node screenshots will result in a strike.

**Territories:**
- Follow RoE
- Any Z-nodes hits a screenshot is required, as previously described.
- Our guidelines for mining in Origin Space (aka Territories) are found here:
- We ask any alliance to send a message in embassy or a message in game that you will be entering territory for Q trial events, and we will our utmost to respond quickly and notify in AC that you are not to be harmed
- If any of our members have a Q trial in a territory not owned by us, we ask you to please send a message to the leadership of the alliance that owns it before heading into their territory

**UPC Miners:**
- As stated in Server 99 RoE: UPC miners are protected by RoE and shall not be hit, including floating miners.
- The exception is a miner that is on a Z-node, in which case a screenshot is required, as previously described. Hitting a non-Z-node UPC miner not in our territories will count as a strike.

**Absences:**
- If you are going to be away from the game for more than 3 days, please let us know in the discord channel "stfc-absences" so we don't kick you out for inactivity.

- Infractions to these guidelines will be discussed with the offenders or applicable offender's alliance Admiral / ROE Officer to discuss the best next steps.

- SPWN has a 3 strike rule we are implementing beginning 10/8/23. We will hold our players accountable for items like no screenshots or ROE violations.


## Alliance Status Meanings

- **Allied** (*Purple Heart*): Do not hit for any reason. If they war, we war, and vice versa.
- **Friendly** (*Purple Spock Hand*): Abide by RoE, can hit OPC. Please only hit Z-Node if you need the node (and screenshots are still required). Bases, Autogrinders, Floaters, Territories, and Token Space are offlimits.
- **Civil** (*Blue circle with a slash in it*): We technically don't treat any different than neutral, but consider this a gateway to becomming NOT blood thirsty enemies.
- **Neutral** (*no mark*): Follow RoE.
- **Caution** (*Yellow Triangle*): Fire watch. Used to mark temporary enemy alliances during territory defense or takeovers, or to find someone. Continue following RoE.
- **Unfriendly** (*angry red face*): Made Steve angry. Hit them often, but follow RoE.
- **Enemy** (*Red Target*): At war. Full KoS (kill on sight). RoE does NOT apply. Armadas and Token Spaces may still be off limits, despite them being KoS so please ask an officer if it's ok to hit them before doing so.

**FOR ALL LABLES: TOKEN SPACES AND TERRITORIES ARE OFF LIMITS UNLESS AN OFFICER SAYS OTHERWISE**

This is a copy of the RoE found in Steve's discord. The version of RoE on discord is considered the primary authority if there are ever any discrepancies between the two. Please join the discord and check the RoE regularly to ensure you're up to date on the latest requirements.
