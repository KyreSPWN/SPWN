## Server 99 Rules of Engagement

Definitions can be found in PVP Target Guide https://www.pvptarget.com/guide 

**Basic ROE as written in PVP Target Guide and summarized as below:**
- All warships within the battle triangle are fair play
- OPC survey ships are fair play, including those sitting in space, returning home from mining, or returning home from a base raid
- UPC survey ships that are floating (defined as sitting in space or moving through space) are off limits
- UPC survey ships that are on z-nodes are fair play

**Off-limit hits:**
- Ships in token space
- Ships in active armadas or waiting for armadas
- Discovery only while mining mycelium and UPC

**Not Protected by ROE:**
- Base raids. Be aware that interfering with a base raid will likely cause hostilities. 
- Bases in general. Shield or Share.
- Survey ships acting as warships, including during base raids or hostile hunting for XP
- Territory, although almost every territory holding alliance will KOS you for hits there.

All alliances are welcome to add additional ROE for their alliance if that addition means fewer allowed hits.
- Example: An alliance can say that they will not hit z-nodes. If adding, the alliance should post and pin that in their embassy channel. 

The above rules promote fair and fun play. Regardless, any alliance at any time can declare war or KOS on another alliance based on its own reasoning, even if other alliances disagree. Should an alliance abuse war, other alliances may band together to put them in their place based on consensus.

**Incursions**
-General base raiding is shield or share, so should be happening all the time
-Begin raiding territory bases 24 hours in advance of incursions
-Suspend ROE 4 hours in advance of incursions

**Amendments**
-No ship is protected, regardless of any other RoE provision, if on a specialty mining node that it is not designed for. Specialty mining node is defined as anything NOT parsteel/Tritanium/Dilithium/Crystal/Ore/Gas/Isogen. For purposes of this provision, Arrock as captain is acceptable for CLAT.

## SPWN specific ROE:

- Our members are required to take screenshots of Z-node hits and keep for 1 week.

- UPC Miners:
    - UPC miners are protected by RoE and shall not be hit, including floating miners. The exception is a miner that is on a Z-node, in which case a screenshot is required, as previously described. Hitting a non-Z-node UPC miner will count as a strike.

- Territories are off limits for pvp with the following exceptions:
    - Time of war (please verify with an officer that Territory hits are OK).
    - Takeover events (We allow it but firmly believe the right thing to do is enter as intended, by submitting the RSS to enter the takeover. While this is our opinion, we respect that others may not view it the same way.)

- Q trial events in territory:
    - Please send a message in embassy that you will be entering territory for Q trial events & we will do our utmost to respond quickly and notify in AC that you are not to be harmed

- Infractions to these guidelines will be discussed with the offenders or applicable offender's alliance Admiral / ROE Officer to discuss the best next steps.

- SPWN has a 3 strike rule we are implementing beginning 10/8/23. We will hold our players accountable for items like no screenshots or ROE violations.


## Alliance Status Meanings

- **Allied** (*Purple Heart*): Do not hit for any reason. If they war, we war, and vice versa.
- **Friendly** (*Purple Spock Hand*): Abide by RoE, can hit OPC. Please only hit Z-Node if you need the node (and screenshots are still required). Bases, Autogrinders, Floaters, Territories, and Token Space are offlimits.
- **Civil** (*Blue circle with a slash in it*): We technically don't treat any different than neutral, but consider this a gateway to becomming NOT blood thirsty enemies.
- **Neutral** (*no mark*): Follow RoE.
- **Caution** (*Yellow Triangle*): Fire watch. Used to mark temporary enemy alliances during territory defense or takeovers, or to find someone. Continue following RoE.
- **Unfriendly** (*angry red face*): Made Steve angry. Hit them often, but follow RoE.
- **Enemy** (*Red Target*): At war. Full KoS (kill on sight). RoE does NOT apply. Armadas and Token Spaces may still be off limits, despite them being KoS so please ask an officer if it's ok to hit them before doing so.

**FOR ALL LABLES: TOKEN SPACES AND TERRITORIES ARE OFF LIMITS UNLESS AN OFFICER SAYS OTHERWISE**

This is a copy of the RoE found in Steve's discord. The version of RoE on discord is considered the primary authority if there are ever any discrepancies between the two. Please join the discord and check the RoE regularly to ensure you're up to date on the latest requirements.
